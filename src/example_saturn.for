c     June 2019, G.K.Stephens: Initial prototype.
      program example_saturn
c
c     This is an example program that demonstrates how to evaluate both
c     the external and internal magnetic field (Dougherty et al. 2018)
c     for Saturn. The coordinate system is KSM (Kronocentric Solar
c     Magnetospheric) and units are in Saturn radii (Rs) and nanoTesla
c     (nT).
c
c     The program can be compiled using the following using gfortran:
c     
c     gfortran example_saturn.for -o example_saturn
c      
c     The expected output of this program is the following:

c     The file containing the dynamic pressure of the solar wind at
c     Saturn. This file is derived from the Tao et al. (2005) model and
c     was obtained from the AMDA archive.
      pdynfile = "Dp.txt"
      pdynfile = trim(pdynfile)

c     Reads and stores the results of the Dynamic pressure file.
c     This call must be made once prior to evaluating the dynamic
c     pressure. Once called, this does not need called again.
      call store_pdyn(pdynfile)

c     The UTC date and time to evaluate the model. The format follows
c     the standard year-month-dayofmonth format, where these fields
c     start from 1, e.g. month=1 corresonds to January, and the time
c     fields start at 0. Year, month, dom, hour, and min are integer,
c     while sec is a double.
      year = 2013
      month = 4
      dom = 21
      hour = 22
      min = 53
      sec = 28.39823d0

c     Evaluates the dynamic pressure at Saturn for the given time.
c     Pressures are linearly interpolated.
      call eval_pdyn(year,month,dom, hour,min,sec,
     .     pdyn)

c     Evalute the Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT or Terrestrial Time or
c     TT) for the given UTC date and time.
      tdt = utc_to_tdt(year,month,dom, hour,min,sec)

c     Evaluates the location of the Sun at the supplied TDT time in
c     radians.
      call ksun(tdt, sunLat,sunLong, zPhi,zTheta)

c     The position vector in KSM coordinates in units of Saturn radii.
      x = -12.381274d0
      y = 3.89018743d0
      z = 2.1981273432987d0

c     Evalutes if the position vector is inside or outside the modeled
c     magnetopause (true if inside, false if on or outside). Note, if
c     the position is outside the magnetopause, the subroutines
c     saturn_ext and saturn_int will still return vectors, but these
c     vectors will not have any physical signficance. We leave it up to
c     the user to decide how to handle vectors outside the
c     magnetosphere.     
      inside = inside_magpause(sunLat, pDyn,
     .     x,y,z)
      
c     Evaluates the external magnetic field in KSM coordinates in units
c     of nT. As stated above, this subroutine will still return vectors
c     even if the position vector is outside the modeled magnetopause.
      call saturn_ext(sunLat, pDyn,
     .     x,y,z,
     .     bx,by,bz)

c     Evaluates the internal magnetic field (Dougherty et al. 2018) in
c     KSM coordinates in units of nT.
      call saturn_int(sunLat, x,y,z, hx,hy,hz)
      
c     The total magnetic field is the sum of the external and internal
c     fields.
      bTotx = bx + hx
      bToty = by + hy
      bTotz = bz + hz

c     Converts the Cartesian total field value to spherical coordinates.
      call cart_field_to_sphere(x,y,z,
     .     bTotx,bToty,bTotz,
     .     r,theta,phi, br,btheta,bphi)

c     Evaluates the distance and the closest location from the supplied
c     location to the Bowl shaped current sheet.
      call distance_to_sheet(sunLat, pDyn, x,y,z, xCS,yCS,zCS, distCS)
      
c     Prints out the results.
